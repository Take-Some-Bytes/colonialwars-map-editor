# Colonial Wars Map Editor
This is ``colonialwars-map-editor``, an optional component of Colonial Wars.
This repository includes:
- A ``React`` frontend application to edit maps that follow the structure defined
at [``specifications/colonialwars/file-structures.md``](
  https://github.com/Take-Some-Bytes/specifications/blob/main/colonialwars/file-structures.md#map-save-file-structure
).

This application is completely optional. It is only meant to help with the creation and
editing of Colonial Wars maps.

## Compatibility
The save files that can be opened by this application currently follows an ***unstable version*** of
Colonial Wars save files. Compatibility with ``colonialwars-server`` is not guaranteed.
